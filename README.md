# Kyurae's Emacs init.el
Kyurae Kim's personal emacs configurations. Free, open to everyone.

## Installation

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/Red-Portal/.emacs.d ~/
    cd ~/.emacs.d
	emacs

By the help of [leaf](https://github.com/conao3/leaf.el) most packages should be automatically installed.
Naturally, internet connection is required at first startup.

In order to properly use org-mode, You should run the commands below

    cd ./github/org-mode
    make autoloads

This will ensure org-mode is up to date with the newest avaiable version.
The Emacs default org-mode is sometimes outdated and this might cause problems.

## Supported Platforms

Fully tested only on emacs29 and Manjaro Linux (The best linux distro available).
All platforms supporting emacs26 exept windows (The worst dev platform exsiting on earth), 
are supposed to be partially supported.

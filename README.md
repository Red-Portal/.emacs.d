# Kyurae's Emacs init.el
Kyurae Kim's personal emacs configurations. Free, open to everyone.

## Installation

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/Red-Portal/.emacs.d ~/
    cd ~/.emacs.d
	emacs

By the help of [leaf](https://github.com/conao3/leaf.el) most packages should be automatically installed.<br />
Naturally, internet connection is required at first startup.<br />

In order to properly use org-mode, You should run the commands below<br />

    cd ./github/org-mode
    make autoloads

This will ensure org-mode is up to date with the newest avaiable version.<br />
The Emacs default org-mode is sometimes outdated and this might cause problems.<br />

## Supported Platforms

Fully tested only on emacs29 and Manjaro Linux (The best linux distro available).<br />
All platforms supporting emacs26 exept windows (The worst dev platform exsiting on earth), 
are supposed to be partially supported.<br />
